# Scripts Repository

A collection of small, self-contained scripts I’ve written for personal use, skill-building, and automation practice.  
Each script is independent and demonstrates problem-solving with Python (and later Go).

## Current scripts
1. **analyze_stocks.py** – personal tool to analyze Fidelity stock data.  
   Built to streamline dividend/gain tracking while also practicing Python, pandas, and structured coding for reporting.

## Notes
- These scripts are not full applications, but focused exercises to explore ideas, tools, and workflows.  
- More scripts will be added over time as I continue experimenting with automation, data parsing, and system utilities.
